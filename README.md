# Localhost Disco
A fancy localhost disco party

## Instalation
Place the the index.php file, and the index-assets folder in your webservers root folder.
The default setup works with a "projects" subfolder (This is the directory that PHP reads).

## Side notes
Note that this funky localhost version is currently not optimized for dynamic folder setup (default only works with a projects sub-folder). I'm looking to improve this in the future. Also, if you have any idea's, let me know!
